Hey everyone!
I hope that this is helpful for us to stay on schedule.
The color of the interface can be updated as well if anyone has suggestions.

Lets do this!

## Project Description
Welcome to the most delicious project you'll ever work on! In this 1/2 semester project, your group will whip up a fully-functional Recipe List Application using the following ingredients:
- **Database**: Postgres
- **Back-End**: Java (Spring)
- **Front-End**: ReactJS
- **Version Control**: GitHub

You'll have three repositories - one for the database (Postgres), one for the back-end (Java Spring), and one for the front-end (React) - that every group member will have access to and contribute to. And guess what? You'll even get a production location to deploy your culinary masterpiece!

## Features

### Required
1. Create, Edit, and Delete Recipes (because who doesn't love a good recipe?)
2. Ability to add/delete/modify steps in recipes with estimated amount of time (timing is everything!)
3. Ability to add/delete/modify ingredients in recipes (spice it up!)
4. Graceful exception handling with helpful messages (no one likes a grumpy app)
5. Local Basic Authentication (keep those recipes safe!)

### Optional
6. Ability to create custom groups for recipes (organize like a pro)
7. Ability to "import" recipes from other websites (because sharing is caring)
8. Dark/Light mode toggle (for those late-night cooking sessions)
9. Mobile-Friendly Responsive Design (cook on the go!)

## Milestones

### Week 1: Project Proposal
- Wireframe of project with mockup of User Interface (think of it as your recipe blueprint).

### Week 2: Backend-API & Database
- Database schema design and initial setup (get those ingredients ready)
- Back-end API Development with Create, Read, Update Delete (CRUD) operations (mix it all together)
- Service account creation (because every chef needs an assistant)

### Week 3: Front-end Development
- Front-End development integrating with the back-end API (make it look tasty)
- Basic Styling and responsiveness (presentation is key)

### Week 4: Final Testing and Deployment
- Test project to ensure all feature requests have been met and it is fully operational (taste test)
- Deploy your project to the assigned server(s) (serve it up)
- Create your 10-minute presentation (show off our culinary skills)

## Roles and Responsibilities

### CPT-166: Database Administrator

### CPT-245: Back-End Developer
- Will create RESTful API endpoints for Front-end to interact with and work with database team to store data in a persistent relational Postgres database (the recipe orchestrator)

### CPT-253: Front-End Developer
- Will create front-end GUI for end-users to interact with and will work with Back-End team to communicate with their API endpoints (the plating artist)

### CPT-271: Security Expert
- This student will ensure security from the database all the way through the front-end application. They will be tasked with securing databases, hosts, OSs, and networks.
